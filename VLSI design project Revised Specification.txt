VLSI design project Revised Specification
Group B: ARC
Group member: Jiang Zhiyuan, Yang Haoxiang, Guan Shanyue, Zhang Yue

We aiming at achieving a CPU with remarkable and balanced performance in this project. 
We found some data of other CPUs on the internet, and decided our specification in week 2. After discussing some detailed information with module leader, we changed some of our specification, the following are the basic features in our revised specification.
Speed: 350MHz
Throughout: 5 stages pipeline
Energy: 8W-12W 
Completeness of instruction: All the instructions in Simplified MIPS32Â® Instruction Set (MIPS32 Instruction Set Quick Reference is attached in the email as a pdf document)

Besides, we decided to add data forwarding unit to our processor, to solve the hazard problems. Scan path will be added to the design to achieve more effective verification.


Individual modules such as multiplexer and shifter (if built in the processor) will be verified first. Behavioural modules shell might be used in the verification of some individual modules, so the waveform inputting and waveform checking will not be done by hand which will save time and reduce mistakes.
After the individual module verification, the whole chip will be verified, a CPU gate simulation test environment will be built in which CPU gate-level design will be surrounded by a behavioural model of all functions external to CPU, test pattern will be generated for verification.
